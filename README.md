# Blobble Stats
Community effort to get Blobble stats/data from the ICON chain.

## Goal
Having simple Python scripts to do fetch data from the ICON Blockchain. To avoid any dependency issues we will avoid any packages but the standard ones. So we will use raw RPC calls and won't be using the ICON SDK for example.

## How to use
Clone the repo and run main.py. For this you will need to have Python installed on your machine.

## How to contribute
Clone the repo, use clear git commits, not 1 giant commit with 50000 changes in it. Try and keep the commits clean and grouped based on logic / utility. Than do a pull request.
